   <h3>About this tool</h3>
   <p>
     This tool is for calculating the required backup capacity for the lead acid
     battery of a fire alarm system based on the overall current draw of the system and
     the required time the system has to remain powered by the battery in event of
     a mains failure in both standby and alarm conditions
     <br><br>
     The caluations are based on a paper released by the NSI found
     <a href="http://www.nsi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FSF-210-Fire-Project-Files.pdf">here</a>

  <h3>BS 5839-1:2013; clause 25.4</h3>

For category M or L systems the battery standby capacity should be
sufficient to maintain the system in an operational condition for at least 24
hours after which there should still be sufficient capacity to provide an
“Evacuate” signal in all alarm zones for a minimum of 30 minutes.<br><br>

If a category M or L system is installed in a building with an automatically
started standby generator and it supplies the fire alarm system then the
battery standby capacity should be sufficient to maintain the system in an
operational condition for at least 6 hours after which there should still be
sufficient capacity to provide an “Evacuate” signal in all alarm zones for a
minimum of 30 minutes.<br><br>

For a category P system the battery standby capacity should be sufficient
to maintain the system in an operational condition for at least 24 hours
after which there should still be sufficient capacity to provide an “Evacuate”
signal in all alarm zones for a minimum of 30 minutes provided that
either of the following conditions are met:<br><br>

a) the building is continuously staffed, or inspected outside of normal
working hours and that staff would be aware of a power supply fault
indication on the system within 6 hours of its occurrence; or<br><br>

b) power supply fault signals are transmitted automatically to an alarm
receiving centre (ARC) and a keyholder is notified by the ARC on
receipt of a fault indication from the protected premises.<br><br>

If neither of the above requirements are met then the battery standby
capacity should be sufficient to maintain the system in an operational
condition for at least 24 hours longer than the maximum period the
premises is likely to be unoccupied, or for 72 hours in total,
whichever is less, after which there should still be sufficient capacity to
provide an “Evacuate” signal in all alarm zones for a minimum of 30
minutes.
